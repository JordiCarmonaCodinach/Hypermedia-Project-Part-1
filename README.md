# Hypermedia-Project-Part-1

Target user profile:
The intended user of this curriculum is someone who has informatic knowledge, as several references are made to various types of knowledge of programming languages and programming skills. It can also be expected that it will be someone without this knowledge but who can understand the curriculum just the same way, since the different skills are each cataloged together with a skill level.

Information architecture:
This curriculum vitae is divided in two parts, the left one contains personal information and the right one contains all the titles and skills.

Visual design:
I used blue and gray colors as a color palette, since I considered that they give it a calm appearance. 
For the typography I have decided to use a font called Merienda, and as its creator says: Merienda has soft shapes, is slightly condensed, and has a rhythm which is an invitation to read short pieces of text, so I thought it was a good choice for my CV. 
For the layout structure I decided to group it in different rows all across the CV, that way the information is clearly separated in different parts, each one with a similar size, so there is no overlap on each other.
